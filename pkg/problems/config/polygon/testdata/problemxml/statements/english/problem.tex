\begin{problem}{Fancy Fence}{standard input}{standard output}{1 second}{256 megabytes}

Everybody knows that Balázs has the fanciest fence in the whole town. It's built up from $N$ fancy sections. The sections are rectangles standing closely next to each other on the ground.
The $i$th section has integer height $h_i$ and integer width $w_i$.\\
We are looking for fancy rectangles on this fancy fence.\\
A rectangle is fancy if:
\begin{itemize}
\item its sides are either horizontal or vertical and have integer lengths
\item the distance between the rectangle and the ground is integer
\item the distance between the rectangle and the left side of the first section is integer
\item it's lying completely on sections
\end{itemize}
What is the number of fancy rectangles?\\
This number can be very big, so we are interested in it modulo $10^9+7$.

\InputFile
The first line contains $N$ ($1\leq N \leq 10^{5}$) -- the number of sections.\\
The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers, the $i$th number is $h_i$ ($1 \leq h_i \leq 10^{9}$).\\
The third line contains $N$ space-separated integers, the $i$th number is $w_i$ ($1 \leq w_i \leq 10^{9}$).

\OutputFile
You should print a single integer, the number of fancy rectangles modulo $10^9+7$. So the output range is $0,1,2,\ldots, 10^9+6$.
